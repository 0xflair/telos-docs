# Overview

## Introduction

Telos is an open source platform built for launching decentralized applications with a variety of features. Telos is the first EVM built on top of an EOSIO blockchain powering EVM developers to quickly build on Telos as Solidity based Dapps work out-of-the-box. 


A key difference between Telos and other decentralized networks is the consensus protocol. Over time, people have come to a false understanding that blockchains have to be slow and not scalable. The Telos protocol employs a novel approach to consensus to achieve its strong safety guarantees, quick finality, and high-throughput without compromising decentralization.

## TELOS

TLOS is the native token of Telos. It’s a hard-capped, scarce asset that is used to pay for fees, secure the platform through staking, and provide a basic unit of account between the native network and EVM. 

## Core layer Consensus Protocol aBFT

At the core layer of block confirmation, Telos uses a asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus mechanism that allows transactions to be processed asynchronously and continue to operate if some of the networks nodes fail or act malicously. The Telos protocol employs a novel approach to consensus to achieve a quick finality, energy efficient, and high throughput blockchain with strong safety guarentees. 



## DPOS - Community Consensus Protocol

Block producers are responsible for providing the network machines to follow the aBFT ran in the Core layer. On top of that there is voting is caried out for which Block Producers can produce blocks. This is known as Delegated Proof of Stake. An energy efficient consensus mechanism that simulates a digital democracy. 

Telos block producer voting is "inverse weighted" meaning that the less votes a user makes reduces voting power. This takes away blockproducers voting for themselves. 

## Telos EVM

Telos has an EVM encapsulated into its native network that generates the same functionality as Ethereum and other EVMs, but has substantial improvements that address problems regarding perfromance, scalability, and energy consumption. The Telos EVM is designed to combat front running so that large institutions or whales performing Defi transactions can't be pushed on top of retail traders in a mem pool. 


## Key Features & Performance Metrics

### Speed

Block produciton: .5 seconds per block


### Scalability

Capable of 10,0000 transactions per second–an order of magnitude greater than existing blockchains.

### Security

Ensures stronger security guarantees well-above the 51% standard of other networks.

### Flexibility

Smart Contracts on the native network are reversable and decided by BP votes. 

### Sustainability

Uses energy-efficient delegated-proof-of-stake consensus algorithm rather than proof-of-work.

### Smart Contract Support

Supports the creation of Solidity smart contracts and your favorite Ethereum tools like Remix, Metamask, Truffle, and more.


### Designed for Finance

Native support for easily creating and trading digital smart assets with complex, custom rulesets.
