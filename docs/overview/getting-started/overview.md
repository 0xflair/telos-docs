# Overview

## Introduction

Telos is an open source platform built for launching decentralized applications with a variety of features. 


A key difference between Telos and other decentralized networks is the consensus protocol. Over time, people have come to a false understanding that blockchains have to be slow and not scalable. The Telos protocol employs a novel approach to consensus to achieve its strong safety guarantees, quick finality, and high-throughput without compromising decentralization.

## TELOS

TLOS is the native token of Telos. It’s a hard-capped, scarce asset that is used to pay for fees, secure the platform through staking, and provide a basic unit of account between the native network and EVM.

## Key Features

### Speed

Uses a novel consensus protocol, developed by a team of Cornell computer scientists, and is able to permanently confirm transactions in under 1 second.

### Scalability

Capable of 4,500 transactions per second–an order of magnitude greater than existing blockchains.

### Security

Ensures stronger security guarantees well-above the 51% standard of other networks.

### Flexibility

Easily create custom blockchains and decentralized apps that contain almost any arbitrary logic.

### Sustainability

Uses energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus algorithm rather than proof-of-work.

### Smart Contract Support

Supports the creation of Solidity smart contracts and your favorite Ethereum tools like Remix, Metamask, Truffle, and more.

### Private and Public Blockchains

Create your own public or private blockchains.

### Designed for Finance

Native support for easily creating and trading digital smart assets with complex, custom rulesets.
