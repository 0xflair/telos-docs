# Getting Started

## Overview

Once your NFT is made and you're ready to give it a new home you must first write it's Metadata! 
NFT metadata refers to the additional information that is stored alongside the NFT itself, such as its name, description, image, and other attributes. This metadata is often stored as a JSON file on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and is referenced in the NFT's smart contract.
You can use pin managers such as Piñata.cloud or NFT.storage's file manager to safely host your metadata and even NFTs to the IPFS network. 
If this is what you're looking for a quick Piñata guild please visit [this](./pinata-cloud) page.

## IPFS

InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing files. It uses a content-addressed system, which means that files are identified by their content, rather than by their location on a specific server. This makes it a powerful tool for creating and managing NFTs on a blockchain.
IPFS is often used to store the metadata associated with NFTs. This metadata includes information such as the NFT's name, description, image, and other attributes. By storing the metadata on IPFS, it is accessible to anyone on the network and is not dependent on a single server or organization.
NFTs can also be stored on IPFS, which helps ensure their immutability and authenticity. When an NFT is created, a reference to its location on IPFS is included in the NFT's smart contract. This means that anyone can verify that the NFT is authentic by checking its metadata on IPFS.

## Your Metadata

Once stored on the IPFS, your metadata can be pulled by dApps and marketplaces to display your Non Fungible Token or NFT!
If you're ready to write up your JSONs you can use the examples shown here for a brief run down on how to get started.
