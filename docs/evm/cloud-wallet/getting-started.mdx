# Getting Started

This is a quick guide to the steps you need to take to get your app connected to the Telos Cloud Wallet in less than five minutes.

:::info
The following information is extracted from the [OreIdAuth class](https://github.com/telosnetwork/telos-wallet/blob/develop/src/antelope/wallets/authenticators/OreIdAuth.ts), which implements all the examples presented in this document.
:::

### Installation

For this integration, you will need the `oreid-js` and `oreid-webpopup` packages, which you can install using Yarn:


### Importing Required Dependencies

To start, you will need to import the necessary utilities and types from the `oreid-js` package:

```typescript
import { AuthProvider, ChainNetwork, OreId, OreIdOptions, JSONObject, UserChainAccount } from 'oreid-js';
import { WebPopup } from 'oreid-webpopup';
```

### Initialice the library

First, we need to set the configuration to initialize the library. You can specify the app credentials like this:

```typescript
const oreIdOptions: OreIdOptions = {
    plugins: { popup: WebPopup() },
    appName: process.env.APP_NAME as string,
    appId: process.env.APP_OREID_APP_ID as string,
};

oreId = new OreId(oreIdOptions);
await oreId.init();

// here the oreId is ready to use 
```

In the appId property you need to specify the id from your app configuration which can be similar to `"t_a4d1e1d175197b379929233ec8c42244"` for test nets or `"p_9233ec919741d18c75a4d4e92b374221"` for main nets.

### Authenticating the user

Once the OreId library is initialized successfully, you can open a popup window to authenticate the user using one of the many available providers for the cloud. In this example, we are using `"google"`, which is currently the only available provider.


```typescript
// popup a window to login the user
await oreId.popup.auth({ provider: "google" as AuthProvider });

// after success you will get the user data from this path
const userData = await oreId.auth.user.getData();
console.log('userData', userData);
```

### Sending Tokens

Once your user is authenticated you can try to send some TLOS tokens as follows:

```typescript
const transaction = await oreId.createTransaction({
    transaction: {
        from,
        to,
        value,
    },
    chainAccount: from,
    chainNetwork: ChainNetwork.TelosEvmTest, // or ChainNetwork.TelosEvmMain
    signOptions: {
        broadcast: true,                     // to effectively send the transaction
        returnSignedTransaction: true,       // to get a response after transaction execution
    },
});
const { transactionId } = await oreId.popup.sign({ transaction });
console.log('transaction hash:', transactionId);
```

If you need to implement an interaction with some specific contract, then you may find very useful the next chapter in which we show how to implement most common actions like sending tokens, staking and wrapping.
