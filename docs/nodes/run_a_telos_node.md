# Run a Node


__ This section describes all the steps to running a Telos Block Producer Node __

The best source of information for running a node is the [node-template](https://github.com/telosnetwork/node-template) repo.
This repo has scripts for easy management of the node, some helpful readme notes and the P2P list as well for both mainnet and testnet.
