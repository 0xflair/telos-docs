# Funding Your Wallet

In our previous section you got your wallet set up and linked it to the Telos EVM. In this section we are going to discuss how to obtain TLOS tokens.

The TLOS token is both the governance and resource token of the Telos network and is used for paying gas fees, voting on network wide governance ballots, and managing transaction quota.

## TLOS for Testnet

You can use the [Testnet Faucet](https://app.telos.net/testnet/developers) to acquire Testnet TLOS. Paste your address from MetaMask and press the SEND TESTNET EVM TLOS button. Once completed, you will receive testnet funds to work with and write data to the blockchain.
