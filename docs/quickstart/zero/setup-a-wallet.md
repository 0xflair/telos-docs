# Set Up a Wallet

## What is a Wallet?

A blockchain wallet (e-wallet, crypto wallet or signer) is a tool that you use to interact with a blockchain network. It is a digital wallet that allows users to store and manage their digital money (tokens or cryptocurrencies). A blockchain wallet allows the transfer of cryptocurrencies between users, and it has the ability to convert them back into a userâ€™s local currency.

A wallet can either be a device or application that stores a collection of cryptographic keys and can be used to send, receive, and track ownership of cryptocurrencies. Wallets can take many forms. A wallet might be a directory or file in your computer's file system, a piece of paper, or a specialized device called a _hardware wallet_. There are also various smartphone apps and computer programs that provide a user-friendly way to create and manage wallets.

When interacting with the Telos blockchain, your choice of wallet software for safely storing and utilizing your tokens is one of the most critical decisions that you can make. Important factors include security, usability, and integrations for dApps and trading. Your wallet is your doorway into the Telos Blockchain network.

Once you have created your Telos account, and linked it with your wallet provider, then you are ready to start interacting with the Telos network.
