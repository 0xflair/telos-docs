# Withdraw, Transfer, and Send TLOS

The tEVM uses TLOS Zero to pay for [gas](../../evm/about/gas-fees.md), which requires that you have TLOS on your EVM account to do transactions. To deposit TLOS to your EVM address, you need to transfer it from a Telos Zero account. TLOS can be purchased on the [web-wallet](https://wallet.telos.net) or through one of the official portals listed on [telos.net](https://telos.net).

To top-up an EVM testnet account, enter the address on the [Telos testnet faucet](https://app.telos.net/testnet/developers) and press the "Send Testnet EVM TLOS" button. 100 TLOS will be sent to that address.

## Withdrawing TLOS from exchanges to Telos EVM

If you currently have TLOS on [Gate.io](https://www.gate.io) or [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com), you can withdraw it to your EVM address by doing the following:


Make sure that the address and memo is:

**Address:** deposit.evm

**Memo:** (Your EVM address)

If not using Telos Wallet, users may want to use https://chainlist.org to connect TelosEVM using Metamask or an alternative web3 wallet/signer.


## Transferring TLOS from Telos Zero to EVM

After acquiring TLOS, you can send it to your EVM address using the [web-wallet](https://wallet.telos.net), which you can also use to send to other EVM addresses such as Metamask. Make sure you have [added the Telos EVM](./setting-up-wallets.md#telos-evm) network to your Metamask.
