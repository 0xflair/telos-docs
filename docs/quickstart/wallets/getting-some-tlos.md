# How to get TLOS

In our previous section we included a link to a guided tutorial on how to create a Telos account and link it to a wallet (signer). In this section we are going to discuss how to obtain TLOS tokens.

TLOS token is both the governance and resource token of the Telos network and is used for voting on network wide governance ballots, managing transaction quota and purchasing RAM. &#x20;

If you are new to crypto, you may not know the important difference between an exchange and a wallet. With a wallet all the assets you store there are completely yours. You and you alone have ownership and control over them. This is what we call self custody or non custodial storage. Exchanges are useful for purchasing or trading funds but not ideal for storage. The exchange has complete control over your funds but you can request transfers or trades. Because you do not have the private key, you do not have complete ownership. This is known as custodial storage because you are trusting custody of your funds to someone else. The aim of the process described below is to withdraw your TLOS into your digital non custodial wallet where you have full control of your funds.

In [this article](https://help.telos.net/en\_US/getting-started/how-to-buy-tlos) we explain how to buy TLOS on the KuCoin exchange, but you can use any exchange listed on [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/telos/markets/)

## How to Bridge TLOS between different chains?

TLOS is the native coin of the Telos blockchain (like ETH is for Ethereum, BNB is for Binance Smart Chain). TLOS now exists on three blockchains – Telos, Ethereum and BSC. While TLOS is fundamentally used on the Telos blockchain, it is also added on other blockchains for reasons such as liquidity and exposure. They’re pegged 1:1 which means that 1 TLOS on Telos is the same as 1 TLOS on Ethererum (erc20) and BSC (bep20). You can bridge/transfer TLOS between blockchains as per your convenience and needs.

This article describes the two primary methods used to bridge TLOS. You will need a TLOS account.
